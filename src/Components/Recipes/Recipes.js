                        <h5>Afghan-Style Saffron Rice</h5>
                        <p>
                            This is a wholesome rice dish that maintains an exquisite 
                            level of delicacy. Serve it as a side for lighter grilled 
                            meats, like chicken or fish. The sweetness of the golden 
                            raisins pairs well with saffron's floral flavor. The onions 
                            and cumin add richness and body to the rice.

                    <p>
                        This is not an authentic version of this dish, but very 
                        much influenced by the delicious Cantonese minced beef 
                        served at restaurants.If you are serving this dish immediately, 
                        you may break a fresh egg over it instead of a poached egg. 
                        Right after you've put it on the rice, make a well, then break 
                        the egg into the well. Mix immediately. Sprinkle freshly ground 
                        black pepper for an extra kick.
