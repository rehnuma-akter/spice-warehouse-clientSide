                        NodeJS is a cross-platform and open source Javascript runtime
                        environment that allows the javascript to be run on the
                        server-side. Nodejs allows Javascript code to run outside the
                        browser. Nodejs comes with a lot of modules and mostly used in
                        web development.

                        Javascript is a Scripting language. It is mostly abbreviated as
                        JS. It can be said that Javascript is the updated version of the
                        ECMA script. Javascript is a high-level programming language
                        that uses the concept of Oops but it is based on prototype
                        inheritance.

                            NoSQL databases like MongoDB are a good choice when your data is
                            document-centric and doesn't fit well into the schema of a
                            relational database, when you need to accommodate massive scale,
                            when you are rapidly prototyping, and a few other use cases.{" "}

                            MongoDB is the most popular of the new breed of non-relational
                            NoSQL databases. Specifically, it's a document database, also
                            called a document-oriented database or a document store.

                            Document structures usually align with objects that developers
                            are working with in code, which is a more flexible approach than
                            the row-and-column table-oriented structure of a relational
                            database. Developers can rework document (data) structures as
                            their application requirements change over time. With this
                            approach, data structures become like code â€” both are under
                            developers' control.

                            environment for building highly scalable server-side

                            and scale; it does not matter if different programming languages
                            and teams write it. You can also test the small units

                            JSON Web Tokens are the new fancy kids around the block when it
                            comes to transporting proofs of identity within an untrusted
                            environment like the Web.

                            A JWT is a mechanism to verify the owner of some JSON data. It's
                            an encoded, URL-safe string that can contain an unlimited amount
                            of data (unlike a cookie) and is cryptographically signed. When
                            a server receives a JWT, it can guarantee the data it contains
                            can be trusted because it's signed by the source

                            JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of
                            claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two
                            parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand.
                            For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long
                            it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been
                            granted.

                            A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots ".",

                            format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like
                            this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.
